% First copy PSTRICKS.CO_ to PSTRICKS.CON.
% Then run "tex386 -i &lplain muthesis" to generate the muthesis.fmt file.
% Delete the PSTRICKS.CON
% Finally make a batch file "mtex.cmd" with "tex386 ^&muthesis %1 %2 %3 %4 %5"
% for a fast-loading version of the thesis style.

% Comment out the equivalent forms of the following lines in the document file.
